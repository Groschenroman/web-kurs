### Search engine(s)

🔍 [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/): When in doubt use [!bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang)  
🔍 [StartPage](https://www.startpage.com/) (Google results, made by IxQuick)

#### Bangs

Can be placed before or after search terms—separated with a white space.  
So either "!g What is the meaning of life?" or "What is the meaning of life? !g".  
Additionally it doesn't matter if the exclamation mark is leading or trailing, so "!g" equals "g!"

❗️ !g = Google results  
❗️ !gi = Google images  
❗️ !i = DuckDuckGo images  
❗️ !w = Wikipedia (english)  
❗️ !wde = Wikipedia (german)
❗️ !leo = Leo word translation (EN - DE)  
❗️ !translate = Google phrase translation

#### Reverse image search

🖼 [TinEye](https://tineye.com/)  
🖼 [Google Images](https://images.google.com/)

Check your device and (social) account settings.  
Don't use apps if the service is available in browser.  
Close apps after usage completely.  
Don't trust link _texts_.  
Don't trust emails that you didn't expect. At least _don't click_ on links!
